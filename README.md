# Sentiment-Analysis-on-Product-Reviews
This project applies Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning techniques to analyze the sentiment of product reviews (positive, negative, or neutral).

📌 Project Overview

- Product reviews contain valuable customer feedback. By performing sentiment analysis, businesses can:

- Understand customer satisfaction levels

- Identify negative trends early

- Improve product and service quality

- This project uses Python and machine learning libraries to preprocess text, train a sentiment classifier, and evaluate model performance.

🚀 Features

✔️ Preprocess reviews (tokenization, stopword removal, lemmatization)
✔️ Vectorize text using TF-IDF
✔️ Train a Logistic Regression
✔️ Evaluate using accuracy, confusion matrix, heatmap
✔️ Visualize class distribution and performance

🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python 3.9+

- NLTK / spaCy – Text preprocessing

- scikit-learn – Model training & evaluation

- Streamlit - Frontend

- Pandas, NumPy – Data handling
